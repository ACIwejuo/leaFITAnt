# leaFITAnt 🌿🤖

An intelligent, autonomous plant care system designed to optimize indoor plant health using environmental sensing, AI-based monitoring, and smart irrigation.

## 🚀 Overview

leaFIT is a project developed to automate plant maintenance using embedded systems and machine learning. It integrates real-time sensor data, AI camera recognition, and wireless communication to support plant care with minimal user intervention.

## 🎯 Features

- 🌡️ **Environmental Monitoring** – Tracks temperature, humidity, light, and soil moisture.
- 💧 **Automated Irrigation** – Waters plants based on live soil data or user-set schedules.
- 📷 **AI Plant Classification** – Identifies plant types using an onboard AI camera.
- 📊 **Data Logging & Analytics** – Tracks plant growth and trends over time.

## 🔧 System Components (subject to change)

- ESP32 microcontroller (indoor and outdoor units) or Arduino Microcontroller
- Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light sensors
- AI camera module
- Water pumps and solenoid valves

## 🧠 Credits

This project was developed with resources by **Group 2 – leaFIT** for the CPE 4850 Senior Design course at Kennesaw State University.
